# Picture Clicker

This repository creates a page with pictures that you can change by simply clicking on the animal name to the left.

## You can try his project by downloading the _site folder and opening the included index.html file.

I use Jekyll static site generator and vanilla JavaScript to build the page dynamically.

Thanks for reading
