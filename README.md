# Picture Clicker

This repository creates a page with pictures that you can change by simply clicking on the animal name to the left.

- You can try this project by downloading the _site folder
- Open the included index.html file in the _site folder to launch the file

I use Jekyll static site generator and vanilla JavaScript to build the page dynamically.

Thanks for reading
